		<p>An Open Game (or Double King's Pawn Opening) is a chess opening that begins with the following moves:

			<code>
                <ol>
                    <li> 
                        e4 e5
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </code>
			White has moved the king's pawn two squares and Black has replied in kind. The result is an Open Game. Other
			responses to 1.e4 are termed Semi-Open Games or Single King's Pawn Games.

			It should not be confused with the term "open game" (lowercase o), referring to a chess position where
			ranks,
			files and diagonals are open, and tending to more tactical gameplay.</p>

	<section class="main-section" id="Ruy_Lopez">
		<header>Ruy Lopez</header>
		<p>The Ruy Lopez (/rɔɪ, ˈruːi/; Spanish: [ˈruj ˈlopeθ]),[1] also called the Spanish Opening or Spanish Game, is
			a
			chess opening characterised by the moves:

			<code>
                <ol>
                    <li> e4 e5</li>
                    <li>Nf3 Nc6</li>
                    <li>Bb5</li>
                </ol>
            </code>
			The Ruy Lopez is named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy López de Segura. It is one of the most popular
			openings, with such a vast number of variations that all codes from C60 to C99 in the Encyclopaedia of Chess
			Openings (ECO) are assigned to them.</p>

	<section class="main-section" id="Italian_Game">
		<header>Italian Game</header>
		<p>The Italian Game is a family of chess openings beginning with the moves:
			<code>
                <ol>
                    <li>e4 e5</li>
                    <li>Nf3 Nc6</li>
                    <li>Bc4</li>
                </ol>
            </code>
			The opening is defined by the development of the white bishop to c4 (the so-called "Italian bishop"), where
			it
			attacks Black's vulnerable f7-square. It is part of the large family of Open Games or Double King's Pawn
			Games.

			The Italian Game is one of the oldest recorded chess openings; it occurs in the Göttingen manuscript and was
			developed by players such as Damiano and Polerio in the 16th century, and later by Greco in 1620, who gave
			the
			game its main line. It has been extensively analysed for more than 300 years.

			The term Italian Game is sometimes used interchangeably with Giuoco Piano, although the latter also refers
			particularly to play after 3...Bc5.[1]</p>

	<section class="main-section" id="Giucco_Piano">
		<header>Giucco Piano</header>
		<p>The Giuoco Piano (Italian: "Quiet Game"; pronounced [dʒwɔːko ˈpjaːno]), a branch of the Italian Game,[1] is a
			chess opening beginning with the moves:
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li>e4 e5</li>
					<li>Nc6</li>
					<li>Bc4 Bc5</li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			Common alternatives to 3...Bc5 include 3...Nf6 (the Two Knights Defence) and 3...Be7 (the Hungarian
			Defence).
			Much less common are 3...d6 (the Semi-Italian Opening), 3...g6, 3...Nd4 (the Blackburne Shilling Gambit),
			and
			3...f5 (the Rousseau Gambit).</p>
	</section>

	<section class="main-section" id="Two_Knights_Defense">
		<header>Two Knights Defense</header>
		<p>The Two Knights Defense is a chess opening that begins with the moves:
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li>e4 e5</li>
					<li>Nf3 Nc6</li>
					<li>Bc4 Nf6</li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			First recorded by Polerio[1] (c. 1550 – c. 1610) in the late 16th century, this line of the Italian Game was
			extensively developed in the 19th century. Black's third move is a more aggressive defense than the Giuoco
			Piano
			(3...Bc5). Black invites White to attack his f7-pawn with 4.Ng5. If White accepts the offer, the game
			quickly
			takes on a tactical character: Black is practically forced to give up a pawn for the initiative. The
			complications are such that David Bronstein suggested that the term "defense" does not fit, and that the
			name
			"Chigorin Counterattack" would be more appropriate.[2] The Two Knights has been adopted as Black by many
			aggressive players including Mikhail Chigorin and Paul Keres, and world champions Mikhail Tal and Boris
			Spassky.
			In modern grandmaster play, 3.Bc4 is far less common than 3.Bb5, and the more solid 3...Bc5 is the usual
			reply,
			so the Two Knights Defense is infrequently seen. It remains popular with amateur players. The theory of this
			opening has been explored extensively in correspondence chess by players such as Hans Berliner and Yakov
			Estrin.</p>

	<section class="main-section" id="Scotch_Game">
		<header>Scotch Game</header>
		<p>The Scotch Game, or Scotch Opening, is a chess opening that begins with the moves:
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li>e4 e5</li>
					<li>Nf3 Nc6</li>
					<li>d4</li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			Ercole del Rio, in his 1750 treatise Sopra il giuoco degli Scacchi, Osservazioni pratiche d’anonimo Autore
			Modenese ("On the game of Chess, practical Observations by an anonymous Modenese Author"), was the first
			author
			to mention what is now called the Scotch Game.[1] The opening received its name from a correspondence match
			in
			1824 between Edinburgh and London. Popular in the 19th century, by 1900 the Scotch had lost favour among top
			players because it was thought to release the central tension too early and allow Black to equalise without
			difficulty. More recently, grandmasters Garry Kasparov and Jan Timman helped to re-popularize the Scotch
			when
			they used it as a surprise weapon to avoid the well-analysed Ruy Lopez.</p>

	<section class="main-section" id="Petrov's_Defense">
		<header>Petrov's Defense</header>
		<p>Petrov's Defence or the Petrov Defence (also called Petroff's Defence, Petrov's Game, Russian Defence, or
			Russian Game — Russian: Русская партия) is a chess opening characterised by the following moves:
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li>e4 e5</li>
					<li>Nf3 Nf6</li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			Though this symmetrical response has a long history, it was first popularised by Alexander Petrov, a Russian
			chess player of the mid-19th century. In recognition of the early investigations by the Russian masters
			Petrov
			and Carl Jaenisch, this opening is called the Russian Game in some countries.

			The Petrov has a reputation of being dull and uninspired; however, it offers attacking opportunities for
			both
			sides, and a few lines are quite sharp. Often a trade occurs and Black, after gaining a tempo, has a
			well-placed
			knight. Pillsbury's game in 1895[1] against Emanuel Lasker testifies to this. The Black counterattack in the
			centre also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano (and other lines of the Italian Game), and the Scotch Game.
			Anatoly Karpov, Artur Yusupov, Vasily Smyslov, Frank Marshall, Vladimir Kramnik, Harry Pillsbury and Fabiano
			Caruana have frequently played the Petrov as Black.

			The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings codes for Petrov's Defence are C43 (for 3.d4) and C42 (for all other
			lines).[2]</p>

	<section class="main-section" id="King's_Gambit">
		<header>King's Gambit</header>
		<p>The King's Gambit is a chess opening that begins with the moves:
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li>e4 e5</li>
					<li>f4</li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			White offers a pawn to divert the black e-pawn. If Black accepts the gambit, White has two main plans. The
			first
			is to play d4 and Bxf4, regaining the gambit pawn with central domination. The alternative plan is to play
			Nf3
			and Bc4 followed by 0-0, when the semi-open f-file allows White to barrel down onto the weakest point in
			Black's
			position, the pawn on f7. Theory has shown that in order for Black to maintain the gambit pawn, they may
			well be
			forced to weaken their kingside, with moves such as ...g5 or odd piece placement (e.g. ...Nf6–h5). A
			downside to
			the King's Gambit is that White weakens their own king's position, exposing it to the latent threat of
			...Qh4+
			(or ...Be7–h4+). With a black pawn on f4, White cannot usually respond to the check with g3, but if the king
			is
			forced to move then it also loses the right to castle.

			The King's Gambit is one of the oldest documented openings. It was examined by the 17th-century Italian
			chess
			player Giulio Cesare Polerio,[1] and also appears in one of the earliest chess books, Luis Ramírez de
			Lucena's
			Repetición de Amores y Arte de Ajedrez (1497).[2] The King's Gambit was one of the most popular openings
			until
			the late 19th century, when improvements in defensive technique led it to decline in popularity. It is
			infrequently seen at master level today, as Black has several methods to gain equality, but is still popular
			at
			amateur level.</p>

	<section class="main-section" id="Vienna_Game">
		<header>Vienna Game</header>
		<p>The Vienna Game is an opening in chess that begins with the moves:
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li>e4 e5</li>
					<li>Nc3</li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			White's second move is less common than 2.Nf3, and is also more recent. A book reviewer wrote in the New
			York
			Times in 1888 that "since Morphy only one new opening has been introduced, the 'Vienna'."[1]

			The original idea behind the Vienna Game was to play a delayed King's Gambit with f4, but in modern play
			White
			often plays more quietly (for example by fianchettoing his king's bishop with g3 and Bg2). Black most often
			continues with 2...Nf6. The opening can also lead to the Frankenstein–Dracula Variation.

			Weaver W. Adams famously claimed that the Vienna Game led to a forced win for White.[2] Nick de Firmian
			concludes in the 15th edition of Modern Chess Openings, however, that the opening leads to equality with
			best
			play by both sides.[3]</p>

		<p>The Bishop's Opening is a chess opening that begins with the moves:
			<code>
				<ol>
					<li>e4 e5</li>
					<li>Bc4</li>
				</ol>
			</code>
			White attacks Black's f7-square and prevents Black from advancing his d-pawn to d5. By ignoring the
			beginner's
			maxim "develop knights before bishops", White leaves his f-pawn unblocked, preserving the possibility of
			f2–f4.

			The f2–f4 push gives the Bishop's Opening an affinity with the King's Gambit and the Vienna Game, two
			openings
			that share this characteristic. The Bishop's Opening can transpose into either of these openings, and in
			particular a favorable variation of the King's Gambit, but with care Black can circumvent this.
			Transpositions
			into Giuoco Piano and Two Knights Defense and other openings are also possible.

			The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings assigns the Bishop's Opening the codes C23 and C24.</p>
